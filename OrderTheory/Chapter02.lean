  # Lattices as ordered sets

  This section is all about lattices which are essentially partial orders with
  some additional structure related to the existence of upper and lower bounds.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.1 Defintions

  Let `P` be a partial order and let `S ⊆ P` be a subset of `P`. An element
  `x ∈ P` is an upper bound of `S` if and only if for all `s ∈ S`, `s ≤ x`. A
  lower bound is natrually defined dually.

  I can't find a separate predicate in Mathlib to say `x` is an upper bound
  of a set `S`. But it does contain notation for the set of all upper (and lower)
  bounds of a set. These are denoted `upperBounds` and `lowerBound` respectively.
  They each consume a set `S` and give back the set `{x | ∀ s ∈ S, s ≤ x}` (or dually
  for lower bounds). The text denotes these by `Sᵘ` and `Sˡ` respectively. I will
  introduce that notation for Lean, just to keep consistent.
-/

postfix:max "ᵘ" => upperBounds
postfix:max "ˡ" => lowerBounds

/-!
  Since `≤` is transitive, `Sᵘ` is always an upper set, and `Sˡ` always a lower set.
-/

theorem isUpperSet_upperBounds [PartialOrder P] (S : Set P) : IsUpperSet Sᵘ :=
  λ _ _ le mem _ smem ↦ (mem smem).trans le

theorem isLowerSet_lowerBounds [PartialOrder P] (S : Set P) : IsLowerSet Sˡ :=
  λ _ _ le mem _ smem ↦ le.trans (mem smem)

/-!
  If `Sᵘ` has a least element `x`, it is called the least upper bound of S. Mathlib
  expresses this as `IsLUB S x`. In fact, `IsLUB` is defined just as in the text, namely
  as the least element of upperBounds. The following formulation is equivalent:

  (i) `x` is an upper bound of `S` and
  (ii) for all upper bounds `y` of `S`, `x ≤ y`
-/

/-- This seems to be true essentially by definition in Mathlib -/
theorem IsLUB_iff [PartialOrder P] (S : Set P) {x : P} :
    IsLUB S x ↔ x ∈ Sᵘ ∧ ∀ y ∈ Sᵘ, x ≤ y := by exact Eq.to_iff rfl

/-!
  The least upper bound of `S` exists if and only if there exists `x : P` such that
  `∀ y : P, ((∀ s ∈ S, s ≤ y) ↔ x ≤ y)`
-/

theorem exists_LUB_iff [PartialOrder P] (S : Set P) :
    (∃ x, IsLUB S x) ↔ ∃ x, ∀ y : P, ((∀ s ∈ S, s ≤ y) ↔ x ≤ y) := by

    · exact λ h ↦ lub.2 h
    · exact λ le _ mem ↦ (lub.1 mem).trans le
  · intro ⟨x, h⟩

    · intro s mem
      specialize h x
      simp only [le_refl, iff_true] at h
      exact h s mem
    · exact λ y mem ↦ (h y).mp mem

/-!
  Of course the greatest lower bound works dually. It is denoted `IsGLB S x` in Mathlib.

  The text uses the notation `⋁S` for the least upper bound of a set (\bigvee) and
  `⋀S` (\bigwedge) for the greatest lower bound when these exist. Mathlib uses `sSup` and
  `sInf` (set supremum and infimum) for these.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.2 Top and bottom

  It is easily seen that if `P` has a top element, then `Pᵘ = {⊤}` in which case
  `sSup P = ⊤`. When `P` has no top element `Pᵘ = ∅` so `sSup P` does not exist.

  ## 2.3 Notation

  For Mathlib, we can write `x ⊔ y` for the least upper bound of `x` and `y`
  as long as we have an instance `[SemilatticSup P]`. (We can actually write it
  as long as we have `[Sup P]` but that type class is for notation only and does
  not enforce the properties of least upper bounds.) Similarly, `x ⊓ y` is the
  greatest lower bound, or infimum of `x` and `y` as long as we have `[SemilatticInf P]`.

  As above, we must write `sSup S` and `sInf S` for the supremum and infimum of
  a set `S`. But again, we need an instance of `[SupSet P]` or `[InfSet P]` for those
  to even make sense. And if we want them to have the properties of supremum and
  infimum, we must have an instance `[CompleteSemilatticeSup P]` or
  `[CompleteSemilatticInf P]`.

  Finally, if we have an indexed family of elements of p, `{pᵢ : P | i ∈ ι}`,
  then this manifests in Mathlib as follows. The existence of this family is denoted
  `p : ι → P`, and we denote the supremum of the family by `⨆ i, p i`. As in all the
  cases above, this notation is unlocked by a typeclass, in this case `[SupSet P]`,
  and it only has the properties we want when we have an instance
  `[CompleteSemilatticeSup P]`. The corresponding dual notation is `⨅ i, p i` with
  all the expected caveats about type classes.

  Essentially, we can only really access the notations for sups and infs of pairs
  or sets if we have notation instances that tell us how such functions are defined. And they
  only have the meaning we want when we have instances of the relevant type classes.
  To put it another way, unless sup and inf are defined for all pairs (respectively
  all sets) then we should not be using the notation. This differs somewhat from the
  text which does use the notation `x ⊔ y` even if it only exists for that one pair.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.4 Definitions

  When both `x ⊔ y` and `x ⊓ y` exists for all pairs `x` and `y` in an partial order `P`
  then we call `P` a lattice. This is a type class in Mathlib: `[Lattice P]`. The text doesn't
  mention at this point structures for which only one or the other of `⊔` or `⊓` is defined
  for all pairs, but Mathlib has this built in. If `⊔` is defined for all pairs then
  we have an instance `[SemilatticeSup P]`. If it's `⊓` that is defined for all pairs
  then we use `[SemilatticeInf P]`.

  If the supremum and infimum exist for all subsets `S : P`, (i.e. `sSup S` and `sInf S`
  exist and have the properties of supremum and infimum) then `P` is called a complete
  lattice. This is written `[CompleteLattice P]` in Mathlib. The one-sided versions in which
  only sups or infs of all sets are defined are written `[CompleteSemilatticeSup P]` and
  `[CompleteSemilatticeInf P]`. The Mathlib definitions for these one-sided version state
  that they are rarely used because any one-sided version is actually a complete lattice.
  I expect this will be discussed in the text.

  ## 2.5 Remarks on ⊔ and ⊓

  (1) If `(x :P) ≤ y` then `{x, y}ᵘ = ↑ᵖy` and `{x, y}ˡ = ↓ᵖx`. It follows that
      `x ⊔ y = y` and `x ⊓ y = x`. Setting `x = y` we see that `x ⊔ x = x` and
      `x ⊓ x = x`.

/-!
  (2) Nothing to formalize here. It's just noting that the `x ⊔ y` can fail to
      exist either because `{x, y}ᵘ` is empty or because it has no least element.

  (3) Nothing to formalize here either.

  (4) If `P` is a lattice, then for all `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`,

    (i) `a ≤ b` implies `a ⊔ c ≤ b ⊔ c` and `a ⊓ c ≤ b ⊓ c`

    (ii) `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d` imply `a ⊔ c ≤ b ⊔ d` and `a ⊓ c ≤ b ⊓ d`.

    These must already be in Mathlib.

  ## 2.6 Examples

  (1) Every chain is a lattice. This is known to Mathlib as LinearOrder.toLattice.
      This has a bunch of observations about ℝ, ℚ, ℤ, ℕ that follow quite naturally
      and are quite intuitive.

  (2) For any type `X` the type of subsets of `X`, `Set X` is complete lattice under
      set inclusion. Mathlib seems to know this by I can't find where it is defined.

  (3) If `𝔏 : Set (Set X)`, then `𝔏` is called a lattice of sets if it is
      closed under finite unions and intersections, and complete lattice if
      it is closed under arbitrary unions and intersections.

  ## 2.7 Lattices of subgroups

  If `G` is a group and ⟨SubG, ⊆⟩ is its ordered set of subgroups, then let
  `H`, `K` be subgroups of `G`. It's certainly true that `H ∩ K` is also a
  subgroup of `G`, so we can define `H ⊓ K` to be the intersection. But
  `H ∪ K` is not typically a subgroup. Nevertheless, the subgroup generated
  by `H ∪ K` *is* a subgroup and is actually `H ⊔ K`. Sadly there is no simple
  general formula for this as a set. Normal subgroups are better behaved. For
  normal subgroups, the set `HK = { h*k | h ∈ H ∧ k ∈ K }` is normal and
  serves as the supremum of `H` and `K` in the set of normal subgroups of `G`.

  Mathlib does not seem to have any declaration of the type of normal subgroups
  of a group `G`. After a little effort trying to make one, I realized it's
  not trivial. It could be a good exercise, but is not the point of the
  current project, so I will defer it until later or until somebody else
  can do it instead.

  Let `L` be a set (type) equipped with two operations `⊔` and `⊓`
  that satisfy (L1)-(L4) and (L1')-(L4') above. Then

  (i) For all `a b : L`, we have `a ⊔ b = b` if and only if `a ⊓ b = a`

  (ii) Define `≤` on `L` by `a ≤ b` if and only if `a ⊔ b = b`. Then `L` is a
  partial order under `≤`.

  (iii) With `≤` as above, `L` is actually a lattice in which `⊔` is sup and
  `⊓` is inf.

  This is essentially `Lattice.mk'` which does not even use `L3` and `L3'`. I

  ## 2.11 Stocktaking

  So Lattices can be completely characterized by `⊔` and `⊓`. In all Lattices,
  the sup and inf are related to `≤` exactly as above. So, we can take the
  algebraic properties as simply given without having to think about LUBs and GLBs
  if that happens to be a more convenient way of proceeding.

  Observe that associativity of `⊔` means that `sSup {a₁, ..., aₙ} = a₁ ⊔ ... ⊔ aₙ` (by
  a simple inductive argument). As a consequence, suprema exist for any finite set of
  elements of a lattice. The inductive argument only applies to finite sets, and of
  course the suprema of infinite subsets of a lattice need not exist in general. So,
  in general, there need not be an instance of `SupSet L` if we have `Lattice L`.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.12 Definitions

  Let `L` be a lattice. It could happen that it has both a `⊤` and `⊥`. We want to
  explore how to think of these from the algebraic point of view instead of the
  order-theoretic point of view.

  `L` has a "one" if there is some element `1 : L` such that for all `a : L`,
  `a ⊓ 1 = a`. Similarly, `L` has a "zero" if there is some element `0 : L`
  such that `a ⊔ 0 = a` for all `a : L`. Then it follows that `L` has an
  algebraic `1` if and only if `L` has an order-theoretic `⊤`, and dually for
  `0` and `⊥`.

  A lattice with a `0` and `1` is called bounded. There does not seem to be a single class for
  bounded lattices in Mathlib. Rather, there is `BoundedOrder L` which is defined
  to be the conjunction of `OrderTop L` and `OrderBot L`. So, to say that `L` is
  a bounded lattice we would have to write `[BoundedOrder L] [Lattice L]`.

  Note that all finite lattices are automatically bounded with `sSup L = 1` and
  `sInf L = 0`. In fact, Mathlib does not seem to have an instance of `SupSet` for
  finite types with suprema. Can I just make one here? In the spirit of not
  worrying about finite sets in this pass, I will leave it alone.

  Recalling 2.6(5), note that `⟨ℕ, lcm, gcd⟩` is bounded with `1 = 0` and `0 = 1`.

  ## 2.13 Sulattices

  Let `L` be a lattice and `∅ ≠ M ⊆ L`. Then `M` is a sublattice of `L`
  if and only if

  `a,b ∈ M` implies `a ⊔ b ∈ M` and `a ⊓ b ∈ M`.

  This manifests in Mathlib as `Sublattice (M : Set L)` that has the
  `carrier` set of elements of `M`, `supClosed'`, a proof that sups
  of elements of `M` are also in `M`, and its dual `infClosed'`.

  ## 2.15 Products

  Let `L` and `K` be lattices. Define `⊔` and `⊓` coordinate-wise on
  `L × K`, as follows:

    (l₁, k₁) ⊔ (l₂, k₂) = (l₁ ⊔ l₂, k₁ ⊔ k₂)

    (l₁, k₁) ⊓ (l₂, k₂) = (l₁ ⊓ l₂, k₁ ⊓ k₂)

  One can check that the algebraic properties of `⊔` and `⊓` are satisfied
  by these definitions, so the product also forms a lattice. This
  is the default lattice instance on `L × K` in Mathlib assuming `L` and `K`
  are both lattices.

  It is routine to show that `L × K` always contains sublattices isomorphic
  to `L` and to `K` (assuming they're nonempty), by taking `{l₀} × K` and
  `L × {k₀}` for any `l₀` and `k₀`. I'll only do one of these.

  ## 2.16 Homomorphisms

  Lattice homomorphisms are maps that preserve sups and infs. It will be
  important to understand how these maps relate to order preserving maps
  on the lattices viewed simply as partial orders. But first we have
  to get lattice homomorphisms defined.

  In Mathlib, a `SupHom α β` requires both `α` and `β` to have `⊔` defined.
  It then consists of a function `f : α → β` and a proof that it preserves sups,
  namely `f (a₁ ⊔ a₂) = f a₁ ⊔ f a₂`. Then a lattice homomorphism from
  `α` to `β` is a SupHom that also preserves inf. Thus `LatticeHom α β`
  comes equipped with a function, and two proofs that it preserves sups and
  infs. Those proofs are called `map_sup'` and `map_inf'`.

  The text defines a Lattice Isomorphism as a bijective Lattice Homomorphism.
  There is no `LatticeIso α β` defined in Mathlib, so it will probably turn
  out that an `OrderIso α β` between lattices `α` and `β` must be a bijective
  lattice homomorphism, but we'll see! Similarly, the text defines a
  lattice embedding to be a lattice hom that is injective. No such definition
  exists in Mathlib, so we'll have to see why.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.17 Remarks

  (1) It is easy to check that the inverse of a lattice isomorphism is a
  lattice hom, and hence also a lattice isomorphism.

    use invFun
  {
    toFun := invFun
    map_sup' := by
      intro a b
      obtain ⟨al, hal⟩ := h.2 a
      obtain ⟨bl, hbl⟩ := h.2 b

      rw [leftInv, leftInv, leftInv]

      intro a b
      simp
      obtain ⟨al, hal⟩ := h.2 a
      obtain ⟨bl, hbl⟩ := h.2 b
      subst a; subst b
      rw [←η.map_inf']
      rw [leftInv, leftInv, leftInv]
  }

/-!
  (2) The text introduces notation for when `K` has a sublattice that is isomorphic
  to `L`. We will see below that when this happens, then there will be an
  OrderEmbedding.

  (3) Lattice homs need not preserve `⊤` and `⊥` if they exist, apparently.
  So it's natural to define a `BoundedLatticeHom` that is a `LatticeHom` that
  additionally preserves ⊤ and ⊥. The text calls these `{0, 1}-homomorphisms`.
  These apparently don't show up until chapters 5 and 11.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.18 Examples

  The text returns to various previous examples. The key takeaway is that
  not every `OrderHom` between lattices is also a `LatticeHom`. However, we
  will see below, that every `OrderIso` is a Lattice Isomorphism. This explains
  why we don't need a separate class for Lattice Isomorphisms.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.19 Proposition

  Let `L` and `K` be lattices and `f : L → K` a map.

  (i) The following are equivalent:

  (a) `f` is order-preserving

  (b) ∀ a b : L, f a ⊔ f b ≤ f (a ⊔ b)

  (c) ∀ a b : L, f (a ⊓ b) ≤ f a ⊓ f b

  In particular, if `f` is a lattice hom, it is order preserving.

  (ii) `f` is a lattice isomorphism if and only if it is an order isomorphism.

  # Ideals and filters

  This section introduces lattice ideals and filters. Ideals form a central
  concept in algebra, and filters have a variety of applications in logic
  and topology. Chapter 10 will focus on prime ideals, and this will form
  the basis for the contents of Chapter 11.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.20 Definitions

  Let `L` be a lattice. A non-empty subset `J` of `L` is called an "ideal" if
  and only if

  (i) `∀ a b : L, a ∈ J → b ∈ J → a ⊔ b ∈ J`

  (ii) `∀ a b : L, b ∈ J → a ≤ b → a ∈ J`

  The above definition resembles the definition of an ideal in a ring. We could
  state it more succinctly as a non-empty down-set `J` of a lattice that is closed
  under join.

  Mathlib has `Order.Ideal P` which is a structure that bundles a `LowerSet P`
  together with a proof that the set is "directed" (with respect to `≤`).
  This means that for any `a b ∈ J`, there is some `c ∈ J` such that `a ≤ c ∧ b ≤ c`.
  Being directed says nothing about closure under `⊔`, however, if `L` is a lattice
  and `J : Order.Ideal L`, then it follows that `J` is closed under `⊔`.
-/

/-- This is known in Mathlib as `Order.Ideal.sup_mem` -/
lemma example_2_20_lattice_ideal [Lattice L] (J : Order.Ideal L) :
    ∀ a ∈ J, ∀ b ∈ J, a ⊔ b ∈ J := by
  intro a amem b bmem
  obtain ⟨c, ⟨hc1, hc2, hc3⟩⟩ := J.directed' a amem b bmem
  have sle : a ⊔ b ≤ c := sup_le_iff.mpr ⟨hc2, hc3⟩
  exact J.lower sle hc1

/-!
  The text says that every ideal of a lattice is a sublattice.

      exact Order.Ideal.sup_mem amem bmem
    infClosed' := by
      intro a amem b _
      exact J.lower' (inf_le_left) amem
  }

/-!
   A dual ideal is called a "filter". More concretely, a non-empty subset `G`
   of a Lattice `L` is called a filter if and only if

   (i) `∀ a b : L, a ∈ G → b ∈ G → a ⊓ b ∈ G`

   (ii) `∀ a b : L, b ∈ G → b ≤ a → a ∈ G`

   In other words, a filter is a non-empty upper set, closed under `⊓`.

   Mathlib calls a filter an `Order.PFilter`, and it is literally defined by
   specifying an `Order.Ideal` on `Lᵒᵈ`.

   An ideal or filter is called "proper" if it is not equal to `L` itself.
   Mathlib has a type class for this called `Order.Ideal.IsProper J` which
   is a `Prop`. Oddly there is no corresponding definition for `Order.PFilter`.
   Perhaps we are typically meant to work with Ideals in partial orders, and
   when filters are used, we can just invoke the dual?

   It is easy to show that, if a lattice has a `⊤`, then an ideal `J` is proper
   if and only if `⊤ ∉ J`.

  # Complete lattices and ⋂-structures

  It's time to come back to complete lattices for which the join and
  meet of arbitrary sets `S` exist. Recall that Mathlib denotes these
  as `sSup` and `sInf`, and this is defined via a type class instance
  of `SupSet` or `InfSet`.

  ## 2.22 Lemma

  Let `P` be an ordered set, let `S, T ⊆ P` and assume `sSup S`, `sSupT`,
  `sInf S`, and `sInf T` exist in `P`. (We will just assume `P` is a
  complete lattice instead, because it's a pain to make the right
  assumptions just for the given sets `S` and `T`, even though it's
  more general.)

  ## 2.24 Lemma

  Let `P` be a lattice. Then for every finite, nonempty set `F`,
  `sSup F` and `sInf F` are defined.

  I'm not going to formalize this, because it doesn't play nice with
  the type classes in Mathlib. If I were to do it, I would define
  a new type class that defines functions `fSup : Finset P → P` and
  `fInf : Finset P → P`. The value of this is questionable, however.
  But perhaps I could instead define an instance of `SupSet P` given
  `[Fintype P]` and `[SupSemilattice P]`? Yeah, that could work.

  `TODO`: define an instance of `SupSet P` from `[SupSemilattice P]`
  and `[Fintype P]`

  ## 2.25 Corollary

  Every finite lattice is complete.

  If I had the above formalizations, I could then upgrade them into
  an instance of a `CompleteLattice`.

  `TODO`: define an instance of `CompleteLattice P` from `[Lattice P]`
  and `[Fintype P]`. This might involve altering the above lemmas not
  to rely on `sSup` existing in general.
-/

/-!
  ## 2.26 Definition

  Let `P` and `Q` be partially ordered sets, and `φ : P → Q` a map.
  Then we say that `φ` "preserves existing joins" if whenever
  `sSup S` exists in `P`, then `sSup (φ S)` exists in `Q` and
  `φ (sSup S) = sSup (φ S)`. The dual definition is obvious.

  This is very similar to Mathlib's `sSupHom` that is a map `φ`together
  with a proof that `∀ (s : Set P), φ (sSup s) = sSup (φ '' s)`. (Here
  `φ ''` extends `φ : P → Q` to a map `Set P → Set Q`.) The difference
  is that in the text, `sSup` need not be defined on all sets.

  In general, instead of `sSup`, I should just assert `x : P` such that
  `IsLUB S x`, etc.

  `TODO`: Figure out if I can better formalize some of the material in
  Chapter 2 to avoid the use of type classes when they are not warranted.

  ## 2.27 Lemma

  Let `P` and `Q` be ordered sets and `φ : P →o Q` be an order preserving
  map.

  (i) Assume that `S ⊆ P` is such that it has a LUB `pu` in `P` and
  `φ '' S` has a LUB `qu` in `Q`. Then `qu ≤ φ pu`. Dually,
  `φ pl ≤ ql` when the GLBs `pl` and `ql` exists for `S` and `φ '' S`
  respectively.

  ## 2.33 Definitions

  If `𝔏` is a non-empty family of subsets of `X` which satisfies condition (a) of
  `example_2_32` (i.e., `h2` in the lemma statement), then `𝔏` is called an
  "intersection structure". If `𝔏` also satisfies (b) (i.e., `h1`) then it is
  called a "topped intersection structure".

  Mathlib does not seem to have classes for these concepts. It would be instructive
  to make some here, since the text is likely to return to them frequently enough.
  I will probably not build a robust API around them, however, unless that becomes
  more obviously helpful.

  ## 2.34 Examples

  (1) Consider `X → Option Y` where we assume `X.Nonempty` and `Y.nonempty`. From observations
  in 1.10, the map `λ π ↦ graph π` is an order-embedding of `X → Option Y` into `Set (X × Y)`.
  Let `𝔏` be the family of subsets of `X × Y` which are graphs of partial maps. To prove that
  `𝔏` is cloased under intersections, use the characterization given in 1.10: if
  `S ⊆ X × Y`, then `S ∈ 𝔏` if and only if `(s, y) ∈ S` and `(s, y') ∈ S` imply `y = y'`.
  So we can make `𝔏` a (topless) InterStructure. If `∣Y∣ = 1` it is actually topped.

  Given a `PartialOrder P` and a map `F : P → P` an element `x ∈ P` is called a
  "fixpoint" of `F` if and only if `F x = x`. Fixpoints are treated in detail in
  Chapter 8. For now we state and prove the following famous theorem.

  ## 2.35 The Knaster-Tarski Fixpoint Theorem

  Let `L` be a complete lattice and `F : L → L` an order preserving map. Then
  `α := sSup { x : L | x ≤ F x }` is a fixpoint of `F`. Further, `α` is the
  greatest fixpoint of `F`. Dually, `F` has a least fixpoint given by
  `β := sInf { x : L | F x ≤ x }`.

  These are indeed in Mathlib, albeit in a slightly different form. Mathlib has
  `OrderHom.gfp F` that is an OrderHom from monotone maps on `L` to `L`. It
  maps `F` to `sSup { x | x ≤ F x }`. Similarly, it has `OrderHom.lfp F` that
  takes `F` to its least fixed point. To show this is a fixed point,
  it has `OrderHom.isFixedPt_lfp`. It also has the fact it is the least fixed
  point by `OrderHom.isLeast_lfp` and also `OrderHom.lfp_le_fixed`. Oddly,
  there is no equivalent `OrderHom.fixed_le_gfp` although it does have
  `OrderHom.isGreatest_gfp`.

  # Chain conditions and completeness

  I skipped the proof that every finite lattice is complete. However, there are
  weaker finiteness conditions that already guarantee a lattice is complete. This
  section introduces those.

  ## 2.37 Definitions

  Let `P` be an ordered set.

  (i) If `C = {c₀, c₁, cₙ}` is a finite chain in `P` with `∣C∣ = n + 1` then we
  say that the "length" of `C` is `n`. (I.e., it's the number of uses of `⋖`.)

  (ii) `P` is said to have "length" `n`, written `ℓ(P) = n`, if the length of
  the longest chain in `P` is `n`.

  (iii) `P` is of "finite length" if it has length `n` for some `n : ℕ`.

  (iv) `P` has "no infinite chains" if every chain in `P` is finite.

  (v) `P` satisfies the "ascending chain condition", (ACC), if and only if
  given any sequence `x₁ ≤ x₂ ≤ ... ≤ xₙ ≤ ...` of elements of `P`, there
  exists `k : ℕ` such that `xₖ = xₖ₊₁ = ...`. The dual of the ascending
  chain condition is the descending chain condition (DCC).

  Mathlib has `Set.chainHeight : Set P → ℕ∞` which is supremum over
  all finite chains `l`, of the length of `l`. This is essentially (ii)
  above (except it works on `Set P`, so we have to feed it `Set.univ`).
  We can use this to define a predicate saying `P` is of finite length,
  giving us (iii). An infinite chain in `P` is essentially (the image of)
  an order embedding of ℕ into `P`. We can thus express (iv) by saying that
  there does not exist an OrderEmbedding of ℕ into `P`.
  The ACC or DCC does not seem to be defined
  explicitly in Mathlib, however, there is `WellFounded.monotone_chain_condition`
  which says that `(⬝ > ⬝)` is well founded if and only if
  `∀ (a : ℕ →o P), ∃ (n : ℕ), ∀ (m : ℕ), n ≤ m → a n = a m`. That means that
  we can usually just substitute `WellFounded (· > ·)` for ACC. But for
  this study, we will express it explicitly, and use the above to prove the
  equivalence. We also explicitly spell out the DCC in the definition
  and show that it is the same (by `rfl`) as the ACC in the dual order.
