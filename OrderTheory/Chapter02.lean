  # Lattices as ordered sets
  
  This section is all about lattices which are essentially partial orders with
  some additional structure related to the existence of upper and lower bounds.

  # 2.1 Defintions
  
  Let `P` be a partial order and let `S ⊆ P` be a subset of `P`. An element 
  `x ∈ P` is an upper bound of `S` if and only if for all `s ∈ S`, `s ≤ x`. A 
  lower bound is natrually defined dually. 
  
  I can't find a separate predicate in Mathlib to say `x` is an upper bound
  of a set `S`. But it does contain notation for the set of all upper (and lower)
  bounds of a set. These are denoted `upperBounds` and `lowerBound` respectively. 
  They each consume a set `S` and give back the set `{x | ∀ s ∈ S, s ≤ x}` (or dually
  for lower bounds). The text denotes these by `Sᵘ` and `Sˡ` respectively. I will
  introduce that notation for Lean, just to keep consistent.

  Since `≤` is transitive, `Sᵘ` is always an upper set, and `Sˡ` always a lower set.

  If `Sᵘ` has a least element `x`, it is called the least upper bound of S. Mathlib
  expresses this as `IsLUB S x`. In fact, `IsLUB` is defined just as in the text, namely
  as the least element of upperBounds. The following formulation is equivalent:
  
  (i) `x` is an upper bound of `S` and 
  (ii) for all upper bounds `y` of `S`, `x ≤ y`

  Of course the greatest lower bound works dually. It is denoted `IsGLB S x` in Mathlib.
  
  The text uses the notation `⋁S` for the least upper bound of a set (\bigvee) and
  `⋀S` (\bigwedge) for the greatest lower bound when these exist. Mathlib uses `sSup` and 
  `sInf` (set supremum and infimum) for these.

  # 2.2 Top and bottom
  
  It is easily seen that if `P` has a top element, then `Pᵘ = {⊤}` in which case 
  `sSup P = ⊤`. When `P` has no top element `Pᵘ = ∅` so `sSup P` does not exist.

  # 2.3 Notation
  
  For Mathlib, we can write `x ⊔ y` for the least upper bound of `x` and `y`
  as long as we have an instance `[SemilatticSup P]`. (We can actually write it
  as long as we have `[Sup P]` but that type class is for notation only and does 
  not enforce the properties of least upper bounds.) Similarly, `x ⊓ y` is the 
  greatest lower bound, or infimum of `x` and `y` as long as we have `[SemilatticInf P]`. 
  
  As above, we must write `sSup S` and `sInf S` for the supremum and infimum of 
  a set `S`. But again, we need an instance of `[SupSet P]` or `[InfSet P]` for those
  to even make sense. And if we want them to have the properties of supremum and 
  infimum, we must have an instance `[CompleteSemilatticeSup P]` or 
  `[CompleteSemilatticInf P]`. 
  
  Finally, if we have an indexed family of elements of p, `{pᵢ : P | i ∈ ι}`, 
  then this manifests in Mathlib as follows. The existence of this family is denoted 
  `p : ι → P`, and we denote the supremum of the family by `⨆ i, p i`. As in all the 
  cases above, this notation is unlocked by a typeclass, in this case `[SupSet P]`, 
  and it only has the properties we want when we have an instance 
  `[CompleteSemilatticeSup P]`. The corresponding dual notation is `⨅ i, p i` with 
  all the expected caveats about type classes. 
  
  Essentially, we can only really access the notations for sups and infs of pairs
  or sets if we have notation instances that tell us how such functions are defined. And they 
  only have the meaning we want when we have instances of the relevant type classes. 
  To put it another way, unless sup and inf are defined for all pairs (respectively
  all sets) then we should not be using the notation. This differs somewhat from the 
  text which does use the notation `x ⊔ y` even if it only exists for that one pair. 
-/

/-!
  # 2.4 Definitions 
  
  When both `x ⊔ y` and `x ⊓ y` exists for all pairs `x` and `y` in an partial order `P`
  then we call `P` a lattice. This is a type class in Mathlib: `[Lattice P]`. The text doesn't
  mention at this point structures for which only one or the other of `⊔` or `⊓` is defined
  for all pairs, but Mathlib has this built in. If `⊔` is defined for all pairs then 
  we have an instance `[SemilatticeSup P]`. If it's `⊓` that is defined for all pairs
  then we use `[SemilatticeInf P]`. 
  
  If the supremum and infimum exist for all subsets `S : P`, (i.e. `sSup S` and `sInf S` 
  exist and have the properties of supremum and infimum) then `P` is called a complete
  lattice. This is written `[CompleteLattice P]` in Mathlib. The one-sided versions in which
  only sups or infs of all sets are defined are written `[CompleteSemilatticeSup P]` and
  `[CompleteSemilatticeInf P]`. The Mathlib definitions for these one-sided version state
  that they are rarely used because any one-sided version is actually a complete lattice. 
  I expect this will be discussed in the text.

  # 2.5 Remarks on ⊔ and ⊓
  
  (1) If `(x :P) ≤ y` then `{x, y}ᵘ = ↑ᵖy` and `{x, y}ˡ = ↓ᵖx`. It follows that 
      `x ⊔ y = y` and `x ⊓ y = x`. Setting `x = y` we see that `x ⊔ x = x` and
      `x ⊓ x = x`.

  (2) Nothing to formalize here. It's just noting that the `x ⊔ y` can fail to 
      exist either because `{x, y}ᵘ` is empty or because it has no least element. 
      
  (3) Nothing to formalize here either. 
  
  (4) If `P` is a lattice, then for all `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, 
    
    (i) `a ≤ b` implies `a ⊔ c ≤ b ⊔ c` and `a ⊓ c ≤ b ⊓ c`
    
    (ii) `a ≤ b` and `c ≤ d` imply `a ⊔ c ≤ b ⊔ d` and `a ⊓ c ≤ b ⊓ d`.
    
    These must already be in Mathlib.

  # 2.6 Examples 
  
  (1) Every chain is a lattice. This is known to Mathlib as LinearOrder.toLattice. 
      This has a bunch of observations about ℝ, ℚ, ℤ, ℕ that follow quite naturally
      and are quite intuitive. 
      
  (2) For any type `X` the type of subsets of `X`, `Set X` is complete lattice under
      set inclusion. Mathlib seems to know this by I can't find where it is defined.
